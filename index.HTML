          <p>I love to sing, my mother says I have a gifted voice "A voice of a Healer" and she says I should use it. I try my best sometimes, I make mistakes but I learn from them, I always try to be the best and participate in everything. Some times it doesn't work but, if I work hard I will get it and win. </p>
          
          <p> There are many  type of singing such as  Classical, Carnatic, Odissi, Hindustani, Folk, Borgeet, Baul, Bhajan, Kirtana, Shyama Sangeet, Ramprasadi. I like carnatic singing the most since it  can be sung for western and classical songs</p>

          <p>I developed interest in singing when I was 5 years old. I also have a youtube named as Krishna's Voyage. I upload a lot of singing and dancing videos there. My forte is carnatic music.

          <p>Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian languages, is a system of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka.It is one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Sanatana dharma sciences and traditions, particularly the Samaveda. The other subgenre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian or Islamic influences from Northern India. The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gāyaki (singing) style. The heptatonic scale of Western musical notation is said to have its origins in Carnatic music, having been picked up by Pythagoras during his visit to India to learn mathematics, thus introducing it to the west. The circle of fifths and several other popular concepts in western classical music have their origins in the theory of Carnatic classical music.[citation needed]

Although there are stylistic differences, the basic elements of śruti (the relative musical pitch), swara (the musical sound of a single note), rāga (the mode or melodic formulæ), and tala (the rhythmic cycles) form the foundation of improvisation and composition in both Carnatic and Hindustani music. Although improvisation plays an important role, Carnatic music is mainly sung through compositions, especially the kriti (or kirtanam) – a form developed between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as Purandara Dasa and the Trinity of Carnatic music. Carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions. Telugu, Kannada and Tamil predominates in the evolution of Carnatic Music as most compositions are in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil or Sanskrit.

      <p>
Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer (usually a vocalist), a melodic accompaniment (usually a violin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a mridangam), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the performance. Other typical instruments used in performances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and chitraveena. The greatest concentration of Carnatic musicians is to be found in the city of Chennai.
